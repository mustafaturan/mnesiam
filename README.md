# Mnesiam

Mnesiam makes clustering easy for Mnesia database.

The module docs can be found at [https://hexdocs.pm/mnesiam](https://hexdocs.pm/mnesiam).

## Installation

The package can be installed by adding `mnesiam` to your list of dependencies in `mix.exs`:

```elixir
defp deps do
  [{:mnesiam, "~> MAJ.MIN"}]
end
```

Ensure `mnesiam` is started before your application.

Elixir Version >= 1.6 with `libcluster`

```elixir
    ...

    cluster_data = Application.get_env(:libcluster, :topologies)

    children = [
      {
        Cluster.Supervisor,
        [
          cluster_data,
          [name: MyApp.ClusterSupervisor]
        ]
      },
      {
        Mnesiam.Supervisor,
        [
          cluster_data[:myapp][:config][:hosts],
          [name: MyApp.MnesiamSupervisor]
        ]
      },

    ...
```

Elixir Version >= 1.6 without `libcluster`

```elixir
    ...

    children = [
      {
        Mnesiam.Supervisor,
        [
          [:"a@127.0.0.1", :"b@127.0.0.1"],
          [name: MyApp.MnesiamSupervisor]
        ]
      },

    ...
```

Edit your app's `config.exs` to add list of mnesia stores:

```elixir
config :mnesiam,
  stores: [MyApp.SampleStore, ...],
  schema_type: :disc_copies, # defaults to :ram_copies
  table_load_timeout: 600_000 # milliseconds
```

## Usage

### Table creation

Create a table store and add it to your app's config.exs. Note: All stores *MUST* implement its own `init_store/0` to crete table and `copy_store/0` to copy table:

```elixir
defmodule MyApp.SampleStore do
  @moduledoc """
  Sample store implementation
  """
  require Record

  Record.defrecord(
    :sample,
    SampleStore,
    id: nil,
    topic_id: nil,
    event: nil
  )

  @type sample ::
          record(
            :sample,
            id: String.t(),
            topic_id: String.t(),
            event: String.t()
          )

  @doc """
  Mnesiam will call this method to init table
  """
  def init_store do
    :mnesia.create_table(
      SampleStore,
      attributes: sample() |> sample() |> Keyword.keys(),
      index: [:topic_id],
      disc_copies: [Node.self()]
    )
  end

  @doc """
  Mnesiam will call this method to copy table
  """
  def copy_store do
    :mnesia.add_table_copy(SampleStore, Node.self(), :disc_copies)
  end

  ...
end
```

### Clustering

If you are using `libcluster` or another clustering library just ensure that clustering library starts earlier than `mnesiam`. That's all, you do not need to do rest.

If you are not using `libcluster` or similar clustering library then:

- When a node joins to an erlang/elixir cluster, run `Mnesiam.init_store/1` function on the *new node*; this will init and copy table contents from other online nodes.

Enjoy!
